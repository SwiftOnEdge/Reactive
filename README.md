# StreamKit

StreamKit is a very small and compact Functional Reactive Programming library
which is used to implement the Edge event system.

It is inspired by ReactiveCocoa, but the API has been greatly reduced in scope
and simplified. The StreamKit API is designed so that it can also be used as a
simple callback system, much like Node.js Events. You don't need to be an FRP
wizard to use it.
